This article covers how to install Mindustry on different platforms and situations. Typical Setup This is your typical, run-of-the-mill setup process. Desktop Visit the game's itch.io page , then download a copy of the game from there. Once the .zip file is downloaded, unzip it. Usually that is just done by opening it like normal. When it's done, navigate to the folder it extracted into. Windows : simply open desktop-release.exe . MacOS : run Mindustry.app. Linux : run Mindustry . If you have JRE already installed (which is recommended), you can also run desktop-release.jar on Windows and Linux. Android This particular section covers how to install Mindustry's latest builds on Android. You might be here because you don't know what sort of Mindustry everyone's talking about on the Discord, or heard of build xx . If so, please read on. Open Google Play Store and visit Mindustry's page. Scroll down a bit and notice the \"Become a beta tester\" section. Press \"Join now\" and confirm. Fully signing up will take a while, so be patient. The green button will then say \"Update\". Update and enjoy! iOS The latest released builds are available on Apple TestFlight. For Contributors If you would like to contribute to the game's source code, the best way to go is to compile the game yourself or use the builds provided here . To compile it yourself: If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Open a terminal in the root directory, then run these commands: For Windows: Running: gradlew desktop:run Building: gradlew desktop:dist For Linux: Running: ./gradlew desktop:run Building: ./gradlew desktop:dist For Server builds, replace desktop with server . Example: ./gradlew server:run For aspiring server hosts Please keep in mind that doing this does not make you automatically cool. Use the local LAN feature if you only want to play with one or two friends. A dedicated Linux or Windows machine is highly recommended for this. If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Download the desired server release from itch.io , or compile one yourself. Open a terminal or TTY session then change cd to the directory the JAR is placed in. Run java -jar server-release.jar . The commands are explained in the help command. If you have come this far, you should already have the skill and time to be able to port-forward if you need to. If you do not know how to port-forward, Google \"portforward your-router instructions\", \"your-router\" being your router's model. Portforwarding will require you to have access to your router's admin settings, which will usually be password-protected. If you do not have access, use LogMeIn Hamachi. To find your IP, Google \"what is my IP\". NEVER SHARE YOUR PUBLIC IP WITH THE PUBLIC, UNLESS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPLICATIONS OF DOING SO! Your public IP is tied to your household, and if it falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to easily find your approximate location, even down to the city or block you live in. There is more that can happen; such as DoS attacks, data and information exploitation and collection, and unwanted access to other open ports in your network. Exercise caution, do your research, and use a VPN if possible. If you would like to host a public server for public use, it is recommended that you use a domain name or DNS service to mask your IP a little bit, or use a cloud service e.g. Amazon AWS which is much safer.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"GettingStarted/#getting-started","text":"Getting started with Mindustry is easy.

One cost = one tick added to build time. For example, the Battery requires 8CP , 30LE , and 4SI . The build time is processed like this: (0.6 * 8) + (0.9 * 30) + (0.9 * 8) = 39 Therefore, it takes 39 ticks to build a Battery by yourself. Hardness [Items] The time it takes to mine one item is partially dependent on the hardness of an item. Sand is the least hardest, while Thorium is the hardest. [needs correction] For example, mining Copper with your Mining Laser gets you copper much faster than when mining Thorium. That is because Thorium is harder than Copper. Radioactivity [Items] Radioactivity is the potency of the material in nuclear-based blocks like the RTG. In said block, Thorium generates more electricity than Phase because it is much more radioactive. Flammability [Items, Liquids] As it suggests, it is the measure of flammability of an item or liquid. It is also the speed at which it burns and the speed at which it spreads across blocks that are made of it, and enemies which are hit by it as a projectile. For example, Plastanium burns slower than coal , which burns much slower than Pyratite . Furthermore, when Pyratite is used as ammo, it will burn enemies faster and stronger than Blast Compound . When Lava is used as an ammo in the Wave, it will burn enemies unlike Cryofluid or Oil . Tip: Make sure distribution blocks (Conveyors, Vaults, Bridges) that contain flammable or explosive materials are protected and kept away from potential damage, like a Reactor or enemy path. For example, if a Reactor explodes near a conveyor with Coal, the majority of the conveyor will immediately explode because of the Coal on it. Explosiveness [Items, Liquids] As it suggests, it is the measure of explosiveness of an item or liquid. That is most useful in an ammunition application, where the most explosive item (not liquid) will deal the largest damage over the largest area. Blast Compound is the most explosive item as its name, \"Blast\", suggests. Oil is the most and only explosive liquid. If shot from a Wave and set on fire using Pyratite or Lava, it will burn and explode enemies that are around it. The same thing goes for Liquid Tanks and the such that are filled with it. Tip: Keep explosive material protected and separate from your Core or any exposed lines, unless it is needed. It is highly explosive and when triggered, will deal damage to surrounding blocks as well. Read the previous tip, too. Fluxiness [Items] Fluxiness is the measure of the ability of an item to be used as flux. Flux is essentially a 'filler' system, substituting the regular resources with masses of cheaper ones. For example, a Smelter will accept Sand, Phase Fabric, and Biomatter as flux, and thus use less of its regular ingredients. The same goes for the Arc Smelter and Alloy Smelter. Tip: In many maps, Sand is an extremely abundant material, so a line saturated with Sand combined with a Vault or Container system that distributes it widely is good practice if you have tons of production. Heat Capacity [Liquids] Heat capacity is the measure of the effectiveness of a liquid in absorbing and dissipating heat. The higher the Heat Cap., the faster it will cool things like the Thorium Reactor down. Temperature [Liquids] The temperature of a liquid. Viscosity [Liquids] Viscosity determines the speed at which a liquid flows. A higher viscosity means it flows slower, while a lower one means it flows much faster. Status Effect [Liquids] The status effect of the liquid is passed on to an entity that is hit by it or is standing on it. Melting Lava has the \"melting\" status effect, which means that enemies that are hit by it (from a Wave) or are standing on a puddle of it will start burning and melting. Tarred With the \"tarred\" status effect, enemies will move slower and be more susceptible to fire. Freezing Enemies will move extremely slow as they freeze. This is useful for slowing down swift air enemies to make them easier to shoot.","title":"Characteristics"},{"location":"characteristics/#characteristics","text":"","title":"Characteristics"},{"location":"characteristics/#cost-items","text":"Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it.

You die when your core reaches 0 health. This is your core: Start by getting ore. Copper should be priority #1, for you only need copper to build the first drill tier and conveyors. Mine with your Mech (see this ) Mine with a drill (you start with 0 copper, so you will need to get 45 copper to get your first drill + conveyors) Let your spirit drone mine Copper for you (see Spirit Drone on this page) Once you have a good Copper income, you can mine Lead. Lead can be mined with the tier 1 drill as well. After lead, Dense Alloy should be produced. Please see Advanced Concepts for the materials processing of Dense Alloy, Silicone, Titanium, Thorium, Plastanium, Phase Fabric, and Surge Alloy. Input / Output Basics Here are a few basics / tips to understanding block input/output behaviors. 1. Conveyors moving away from a production block will be output. This drill will mine and put ore on all conveyors that take the ore away from the drill. In this example, the drill will put Lead on all 7 conveyors, but not the eight one because that conveyor moves towards the drill. The drill will prioritize each path evenly. If a path is blocked, it is not considered as an output. Notice that a conveyor moving into the Core deposits the material into the core inventory. Once a material is in the Core inventory, you can use it to build immediately, regardless of location. 2. Conveyors moving towards a block will be an input for the block (only if applicable). In this example, a Smelter is turning 2 Lead , 1 Copper , and 1 Coal into 1 Dense Alloy . The Smelter is smart enough to know that the belts moving towards the Smelter are inputs and the one conveyor moving away is the output. A block that takes materials as inputs will not accept any materials that it cannot utilize. Here is a quick summary of inputs and outputs. A GREEN arrow is an input. A RED arrow is a possible output. Any conveyor facing towards the block will be considered an input. Any conveyor facing away from the block is considered an output. This doesn't make much sense for a drill, since drills cannot take any solid item inputs. But this will apply for other crafting blocks which will be covered later. (This concept also applies for liquids, also covered later) 3. Blocks that output can directly place into other blocks. This last example is a Pneumatic Drill mining stone and using a Pulverizer to turn it into sand. A pulverizer turns stone into sand by using power. Notice the drill does not use any conveyors; the stone goes directly into the pulverizer . Please note that touching blocks are considered outputs and will be the same output priority as a conveyor or other blocks. Mech Mining If you do not start near copper patches, it might be difficult to begin your game. Having copper income is the very first thing you need to set up, because all drills and conveyors use copper. To mine, tap on a single ore square. The mech will start mining with a laser. You will see ore flying out of the patch. If a mine (any ore square) is close enough to your core, the items will automatically fly right to the core. If a mine is not close enough, the mined ore will fly onto your mech. There is not a good way to determine how much ore your mech is carrying, but your mech will stop mining once it is full. You will also notice that your mech is much slower than before. You can only hold one type of material at a time. To drop off the mined ore or current mech inventory, on mobile, tap and hold on a spot near your mech. On desktop, drag from your mech to the recipient. A small icon (a circle with the ore icon) will appear. The recipient block will display its outline if it can accept the item. Drag this over the core to deposit it in the core inventory. Drag it into any block which accepts the item to drop it off in the block. Drag it to an empty space to discard it. You can pick things off of a conveyor. Click on the conveyor. The conveyor contents will show up. Tap/click on the icon to pick it off the belt and add it to your mech's inventory. This is very useful when there is one item blocking the path due to a contamination or error. You can also take items out of any block that accepts or produces items. In the above example, the Smelter cannot produce Dense Alloy because it lacks Copper. Why? Because the conveyor has 1 Titanium, which the Smelter cannot accept, thus, it backs up the rest of the conveyor. Spirit Drone A single spirit drone will spawn for you. This and other drones will mine, help build, and repair blocks. If the spirit drone originating from your core dies, a new one will spawn from the core shortly. You cannot control what drones do. The drones' priorities go as follows: Mine Ores > Assist in building > Repair blocks While building, drones will stop assisting and quickly mine ores that are running out. Tips and Tricks You can confirm a block, cancel the build (this will stop your mech from building, but the confirmed build will remain) and continue this one block a time to set up a large queue. This can be helpful when you want to get something started, but need to address something else first. Drones will not work on these queues, so this is only a placeholder. Containers making contact with your Core will act like extra inventory for your Core. This not only gives more inventory space, but allows for more space to input raw materials, as well as output raw materials from your inventory (See Unloader) An Unloader will take materials out of both the Core or connected Containers because they now share the same inventory space.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#basics","text":"The goal of the game is to not die! You die when your core reaches 0 health. This is your core: Start by getting ore. Copper should be priority #1, for you only need copper to build the first drill tier and conveyors. Mine with your Mech (see this ) Mine with a drill (you start with 0 copper, so you will need to get 45 copper to get your first drill + conveyors) Let your spirit drone mine Copper for you (see Spirit Drone on this page) Once you have a good Copper income, you can mine Lead. Lead can be mined with the tier 1 drill as well. After lead, Dense Alloy should be produced. Please see Advanced Concepts for the materials processing of Dense Alloy, Silicone, Titanium, Thorium, Plastanium, Phase Fabric, and Surge Alloy.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#input-output-basics","text":"Here are a few basics / tips to understanding block input/output behaviors. 1. Conveyors moving away from a production block will be output. This drill will mine and put ore on all conveyors that take the ore away from the drill. In this example, the drill will put Lead on all 7 conveyors, but not the eight one because that conveyor moves towards the drill. The drill will prioritize each path evenly. If a path is blocked, it is not considered as an output. Notice that a conveyor moving into the Core deposits the material into the core inventory. Once a material is in the Core inventory, you can use it to build immediately, regardless of location. 2. Conveyors moving towards a block will be an input for the block (only if applicable). In this example, a Smelter is turning 2 Lead , 1 Copper , and 1 Coal into 1 Dense Alloy . The Smelter is smart enough to know that the belts moving towards the Smelter are inputs and the one conveyor moving away is the output. A block that takes materials as inputs will not accept any materials that it cannot utilize.","title":"Input / Output Basics"},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#here-is-a-quick-summary-of-inputs-and-outputs","text":"A GREEN arrow is an input. A RED arrow is a possible output. Any conveyor facing towards the block will be considered an input. Any conveyor facing away from the block is considered an output. This doesn't make much sense for a drill, since drills cannot take any solid item inputs. But this will apply for other crafting blocks which will be covered later. (This concept also applies for liquids, also covered later) 3. Blocks that output can directly place into other blocks. This last example is a Pneumatic Drill mining stone and using a Pulverizer to turn it into sand. A pulverizer turns stone into sand by using power. Notice the drill does not use any conveyors; the stone goes directly into the pulverizer . Please note that touching blocks are considered outputs and will be the same output priority as a conveyor or other blocks.","title":"Here is a quick summary of inputs and outputs."},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#mech-mining","text":"If you do not start near copper patches, it might be difficult to begin your game.
